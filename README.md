Mario Tennis Calculator
=================

A simple tool that will let you calculate your stats based on the equipment you have given your Mii. 

### Using the calculator
Simply download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in a browser of your choosing. It's HTML5 based, so you should probably use something that isn't Internet Explorer.

Choose the type of equipment you want to use to see how it affects your Mii's stats. Each change will automatically update the totals. You can compare up to 4 different loadouts at once.

### Future features
I doubt I will do much more to improve this app. If you would like to see something in particular though, feel free to request it on the issue tracker.
